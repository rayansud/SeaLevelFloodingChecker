# SeaLevelFloodingChecker

This simple python script lets you input your birth year, and your current hometown. Input an Elevation API key in the variable "elevation_key", and a Geocoding API key in the variable "goecoding_key".

It calculates an average worst-case sea level rise, find the users city using Google Maps Geocoding, find the users elevation using Google Maps Elevation API, and the year in which that city will be submerged.

It uses [this](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7481/full/nature12829.html) article in Nature, forecasting a 4ÂºC rise in average temperature by 2100, and [this](https://phys.org/news/2015-10-sea-swallow-miami-orleans.html) report on a research paper that suggests an upper limit of ~9 meters of sea level rise due to emissions by 2100


*This is all approximate, none of it is my data, and I cannot personally confirm that your home will be submerged at the year specified. Use at your own risk.*
